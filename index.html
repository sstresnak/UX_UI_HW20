      <p class="lead">By redesigning the Solace Orphanages website we aim to help the stakeholders improve the UI of the
        website to help engage users, develop a brand voice, and build trust and credibility in the organization.</p>

        <h4>Role/Team</h4>
        During this redesign we shared primary responsibility for data synthesis and analysis as well as user
        interviews. My main task involved being a primary designer for the web design wireframes and prototyping.

        The client was the 3 primary stakeholders for the non-profit. We began this project on the 3rd of January and
        had two weeks to complete the task.

        <h3>Problem Statment</h3>
        We are redesigning Solace to facilitate donors in trusting that they are contributing to a worthy cause. We have
        observed that a lack of UI and responsive design is discouraging users from engaging with the orphanage. Based
        on our research we have discovered that people are more willing to donate to causes they care about and 68% of
        people do not donate if they believe the organization to be untrustworthy. How might we improve the UI to make
        the website feel more credible?
        To find a solution to the problem we established, we conducted a survey and competitor analysis, interviewed
        stakeholders, iterated based on several rounds of testing, reviewed data, designed a mood board, storyboard, and
        created a brand matrix with a brand statement. When developing our interview and survey questions we wanted to
        address the main concerns an average person would have when viewing the website. Credibility, legitimacy,
        information focus, and an idea of who the organization represents were all at the forefront of our minds.

        <h3>Research Analysis</h3>
        Our priority when conducting our research and analysis was to understand what draws users to other charity organizations. To discover this,  we surveyed 22 people, performed a competitor analysis on 3 well known sites, did a heuristics evaluation on the current website and completed six usability tests. After we completed these goals we had a better understanding of who the user may be. This aligned with what we had previously assumed, users value, credibility, legitimacy, and information when selecting a charity to donate to.

        <h3>User Persona</h3>
        When narrowing down a user persona for the Solace website our team felt it was important to emphasis the heart behind charities. Most of these humanitarian organizations rely on peoples donations to keep up costs. Our persona is tech savvy, stays up to date on current events, gives back to their community, understand the impact they are making, and try's to make the world a better place.

          <h3>User Flow</h3>
          After the interview with the stakeholders we understood how they wanted the website to look. They wanted to focus almost all efforts into a donation flow. I held exclusive proprietorship over the assigned responsibility of the user flow, and this helped me focus in on the user’s desired path. The stakeholders were discussing different payment methods that the user could user on the website so I integrated that into the flow. The stakeholders were uninterested in keeping a prayer partners list but do to our research we knew how important the users value being kept up to dat on where their donations are going so I also implemented that into the flow.

            <h3>Concepts, Sketching, Wireframes</h3>
            When developing the website layout our team unanimously agreed that the whole site needed to be reworked. After comparing it to other sites and knowing we had to include a focus on donations we really wanted to grab the users attention. A hero image at the top to engage the user right away followed quickly about who the organization is and why you should donate. We included the donate button at the top and the middle of the page for easy access as well.  We focused on legitimizing the checkout process by cross referencing several existing UI designs.

              The next plan of action was to create color palettes and typography that would help communicate the brands identity and also give the product an exciting feel.

              <h3>Test: Validation, Usability, and Feedback</h3>
              As we iterated and changed the layout of the page we noticed that we were receiving a majority of positive feedback. The main changes our team made based on suggestions we layout, text length, color, and alignment. 
              The interviews lasted only a couple of minutes and everyone was able to quickly go through the checkout process when following the donation flow just as the stakeholders requested.

              <h3>Changes & Conclusion</h3>
              As the project progressed I took a more featured role for developing the web design while another team member undertook the mobile version. Our third member had personal ties to the stakeholders and she kept us on track with their idea’s. A couple days before the project was due the team member in charge of the mobile design reached out wanting my feedback on the design since I hadn't seen it yet and I was established as the member making design decisions. The UI of the mobile did not match the website  and I had to help coach them through the necessary changes and how the original was poorly developed and did not meet accessibility standards. In the end, the mobile version is a variation of the website. I would have liked to work longer with my team mate but I had to prioritize my own tasks in order for the project to be submitted on time.
              In conclusion, the website and mobile versions were created through careful consideration of the stakeholder's wants and ideas while incorporating modern UX and UI principles. The current high-fidelity models have received positive feedback but need to be presented to the stakeholders. The next step for further development would be conducting another stakeholder meeting to see if the current website meets their expectations and needs. Then based on their responses either more testing and iterating would need to be conducted or the process of talking to a web developer would need to start.
